# Dialogue Node Editor

A node editor for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition dialogue files.

## Usage

Once you have a dialogue file open, run the `bedrockDialogueEditor.openNodeEditor` command to have the node editor open in a new tab.

## Configuration

The tab sizing in the underlying JSON file is determined by the `editor.tabSize` setting.

## Known Issues

Dialogue files containing rawtext will not open. This feature has yet to be implemented.
